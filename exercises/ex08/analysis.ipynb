    "Continuous Improvement embraces a belief there is _always room to make things better_. It is a mindset and process we value and practice in this course. In this assignment, you are able to practice continuous improvement and contribute to the design ideas of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainstorming Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflect on your personal experiences and observations in COMP110 and **brainstorm modifications to the course that _create value_ beyond its current design**. When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example A: \"The course should use only examples from psychology experiments because it will be more relevant for students who are psychology majors.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example B: \"The course should not have post-lesson questions because they are not useful for most students in the class.\""

    "## Connecting with Available Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you have available for this analysis is limited to the anonymized course survey you and your peers filled out a few weeks ago. The data is found in the `survey.csv` file in this exercise directory. Each row represents an individual survey response. Each column has a description which can be found on the project write-up here: <https://22s.comp110.com/exercises/ex08.html>\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the list of available data and identify which one of your ideas _does not_, or is _least likely to_, have relevant data to support the analysis of your idea to create value. In the box below, identify which of your ideas lacks data and suggest how we might be able to collect this data in the future. One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it. Identifying new data sources can unlock improvements!"

    "\n",
    "1. The course should have notes with knowledge points mentioned in lecture videos because it will be useful for students who make their own notes to check if they miss any key points.\n",
    "2. The course should offer reviewing materials before synchronous practice lessons because they allow students who don't have much prior experience in computer science to better prepare for the upcoming class.\n",
    "3. The course should reduce the number of quizzes because most students who have spent lots of time using digital technology to do school work may feel stressed about frequent exams.\n",
    "4. The course should use cases and examples related to majors other than Computer Science because students from other majors can be more involved in this course with familiar contents.\n",

    "The results from the three subsets related to the prior programming experience students had can reflect that most students do not have fundamental knowledge about programming in COMP110. The results support my idea of adding pre-class reviewing materials before the practice class on Thursday if most students do not have much prior programming skills and experience. Although we cannot tell that students without much experience in programming will definitely have difficulties in learning new contents in COMP110, providing pre-lession review materials before doing practices in Thursday's classes may help students better understand what they learnt in Tuesday's videos and prepare for the inclass practice.\n",

    "The potential costs of adopting the idea will be more on the professor side since professor might need to spend extra time providing summary of key points and materials for review each week. Additionally, students may have different opinions on the extra pre-class materials for review. Some may regard it as an opportunity to consolidate their understanding on knowledge while others may think it takes extra time to work on their school work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the idea is feasible, professor can first do a poll to see if students prefer pre-lession review materials. If students love to have more materials to help them learn better, professor can consider adopting the idea. However, if most students are confident in their course work and do not need such materials, then professor can put this idea aside."
